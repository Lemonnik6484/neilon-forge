## Update policy

Unless we see high demand, or we need it ourselves, we will follow the latest Minecraft version by looking
at [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), as this mod is used primarily for
the [SnackBag Create mod server](https://snackbag.net/).

## Testing

There are two Neilon testing phases. First, we have set up JUnit tests for the most operations you can do. These tests
are followed by the ingame tests we issue to ensure everything works as intended.
